DJGPP 2.04 versus 2.03:

Only 2.04 has inttypes.h.  libtcd doesn't use the inttypes.h extras, so for
maximum compatibility leave it with stdint.h.  DJGPP also has io.h but it
adds no value here.

XTide needs 2.04 for correct time zone handling and a format from inttypes.h,
but libtcd itself is not so constrained.
